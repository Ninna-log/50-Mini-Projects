Event Keyboard

In this project I built a little application that shows
the keyCode and the code for any key on the keyboard by 
pressing any key on the keyboard, and then inmediately
the application shows the actual key, the keyCode and the
eventCode according to the key that was pressed.

It's like an example of the https://keycode.info/ web page
