Expanding Cards

The main goal is to design cards that can be expanded by clicking on them one by one.
So, in the HTML within the div container with the class .container are 5 panels or 5 cards
with an h3 each of them. Every panel is identified with a class .panel, and only 1 of them has
the class .active which will be the active panel that will be expanded when the click event
listener is triggered.

In the CSS is the body {} where is specified as the father of each panel, so that's because
has a display: flex, that enables every panel next to each other, side by side; then
an align-items: center, that puts every panel in the right-center of the body as the
div .container father.

In the script.js I wrote a few lines of code, starting by defining a const
variable with the name 'panels' where every panel written in the HTML will
be saved into a Node list by using Jquery selector (document.querySelectorAll ('. panel'))
because it allows us to select anything we want. We can see the array by console.log (panels).
Then we loop in panels' array with a forEach that receives as a parameter
an anonymous panel with an arrow function: so, with every click event in any panel, the
.active class will be added to the chosen panel, and the other panels that weren't chosen
or were previously chosen, their class .active will be removed by the removeActiveClasses ()
function.
